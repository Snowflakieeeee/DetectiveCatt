Hello there, I am mochi (well thats how I am known in Discord) 
I am a pretty young developer that works in Python, C, C++, Little bit of JS and html 
Gave up on rust because of its slight complexity but might give it a try later
Currently interested in working to make programming languages (Duckie lang, Kidscript, are few i worked on) and my most recent one I am working on is called Zmm (or Z--) for no apparent reason

I always run out of ideas so feel free to send ideas on my Discord :-
For contacting me, my discord is Snowflake#3636


Cat out~
